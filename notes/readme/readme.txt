"As a warning, neither this decompiler nor even UTMT can be perfect.
There's likely gonna be some stuff you're gonna have to fix on your own.
Most notably asset indices. GameMaker stores assets referenced in the code as just numbers,
and the decompiler would have to GUESS which variables are for assets and which aren't." - The note the decompiler left

oh well

Thank you for using Voidy's PizzaTower_Boss_v12 decomp, this was a solo effort at making a good decomp with state enus, smoothcam, tv and more
Please credit when using this decomp for your mods or fangames, I wouldn't care all too much but it would be very much appreciated
Made with RadixComet's modification of Loypoll's decompiler (haha I have it and you probably don't! (joke!))

Features:
Smooth camera (like the camera in grape engine)
TV HUD (full game style)
Some toggles for stuff from eggplant-fullgame (like new pizza time music)
